# Grade Calculator

This project is a simple Java program that calculates a student’s total marks, average, and grade.

The user enters marks for Quiz, Assignment, Midterm, and Final exams. The program checks that the marks are within valid limits and then calculates the total and grade.

Grades are given as:

* A for 85 and above
* B for 70 to 84
* C for 50 to 69
* Fail for below 50

It helps students easily find out their performance based on entered marks.
